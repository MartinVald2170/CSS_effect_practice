# Please Read
## This Respository is where I keep my CSS effects that I have written out through trial and error either when I can't sleep or have time

# 
## If you are here just to copy and paste and play around, all I ask is for you to show me your final product either through a picture or code in the "Creation" folder I have made 
# 
## I try to have fun and keep myself entertained so you'll probably see things I enjoy like anime or video games

## Time taken to learn each effect:<br> Animated Social Panel - 2.5 hrs <br> Hover - 3hrs
